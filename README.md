# Command::Poster

This is a demo gem for working with vcr and webmock.  I'm using the github api issues to excercise the simple client and methods.
It's called command poster for no particular reason.

## Installation

```ruby
bundle install
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install command-poster

You can also trouble shoot locally with:

    $ ruby bin/command-poster

## Usage

We don't really do much other than list issues on a default project.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
